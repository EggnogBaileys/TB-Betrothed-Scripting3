# TB-Betrothed-Scripting3
A short game made as an exercise for Scripting 3 in Unity, by Malone Mast.

“Betrothed”
A turn-based action-adventure game in which you must combat enemy after enemy, choosing one of two upgrades after each battle.

CONTROLS:
- A+D keys to move currently equipped item side to side.
- Left-click to attack.

COMBAT OVERVIEW:
- Player turn and enemy turn constantly switch via a timer, which changes in length throughout each battle.
- When you are wielding the spear during the player attack turn, attack the enemy by moving toward their sprite and left-click to swing.
- Alternatively, hold down the left-mouse button to do a powerful charge attack.
- When you are wielding the shield during the enemy attack turn, move it toward hazard indicators to block incoming damage.

PROGRESSION
The progression is mostly simple and linear. Battle enemy after enemy, and between each enemy, your only source of non-linear progression depends on the specific upgrades you had chosen. 
There are 5 battles, ending in a boss battle. 

TIP: Charge attacks are your best friend. Hold down left-click till your spear turns white, and release to do great damage.
If you are having trouble, Charge Damage and Defensive Resilience are by far the best stats to upgrade! 
Good luck, and I hope you enjoy!
